### A Firefox extension that adds a volume controller to the Audible webplayer

Audible Volume Control is an extension that was created because I personally was tired of not being able to control the volume when using the Audible web-player.

At the time of writing this, Audible has just announced that they are discontinuing their native Audible app for Windows (it will probably be replaced with the Android version in Windows 11). Now, the only option that remains is the web-player.
